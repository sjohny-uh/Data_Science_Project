# Causal Inference in UK Stock Market Trading

This project investigates the **true causal drivers** of stock price movements in the UK market by integrating **macroeconomic indicators** and **technical analysis**. It leverages **causal inference techniques** (e.g., Granger causality, DoWhy) and compares models built on causally validated features against those based solely on correlation.

## Project Objectives

- Identify macroeconomic and technical indicators with **causal influence** on UK stock prices.
- Compare predictive performance of models using **causally filtered features** vs. all features.
- Evaluate the potential for causal inference to improve **quantitative trading strategies**.
